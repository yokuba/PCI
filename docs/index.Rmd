We developed a machine learning algorithm to "read" the *People's Daily* --- the official newspaper of the Communist Party of China --- and predict changes in China's policy priorities using **only** the information in the newspaper. The output of this algorithm, which we call the Policy Change Index (PCI) of China, turns out to be a leading indicator of the actual policy changes in China since 1951. The nearby figure plots the PCI against the ground truth of China's policy changes. The PCI often spikes months before policy changes take place, validating the index's predictive power.

Note: The PCI series is a predictor of policy changes. A spike in the PCI signals an upcoming policy change, while a vertical bar marks the occurrence of an actual policy change labeled by the respective event.

#### **\ \ \ \ What's new**

- Oct 22, 2018: Both the [**research paper**](http://www.policychangeindex.com/Reading_China.pdf) and the [**source code**](http://github.com/open-source-economics/PCI) were made available.

- Jun 23, 2018: We received with gratitude NVIDIA's Academic GPU Grant, with the donation of a Titan Xp for this research.
